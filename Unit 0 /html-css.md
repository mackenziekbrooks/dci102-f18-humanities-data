# HTML + CSS
HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is one of the basic building blocks of the web. HTML is a set of tags that add structure to documents. 

You can see the HTML for a basic website at the [W3 Schools HTML tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/). 

In fact, you can see the HTML for any page on the web by right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "view source."
