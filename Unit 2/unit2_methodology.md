  # Unit 2 / Network / Methodology
Networks are everywhere. Once you start, it's hard to stop seeing them. The internet is a network, Facebook is a network, [Kevin Bacon is the central node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) in the Hollywood network. Studying the connections between people and things is a major activity in the humanities, so "network analysis" feels like a natural method for working with humanities data. 

As we saw in Unit 1, we certainly *can* take statistical and mathematical methods and apply them to humanities data. As we learn about network analysis in this unit, we will consider whether or not we *should* use it with our data.

 
## Defining methods
### Networks, nodes, and edges
A network is, as Scott Weingart [says](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/), "stuff and relationships." One piece of "stuff" is a "node" and the relationship/connection between two pieces of "stuff" is an "edge." Nodes are also called points, vertices, or agents. 

### Network analysis
Network analysis varies by discipline, but originates from graph theory in mathematics. This is a simplification, but the idea is that one can measure the important nodes in a network by how many connections they have to other nodes and by the weight/significance of those connections. If you're math literate, you can read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science).

### Social network analysis
Social network analysis, or SNA, is used by social scientists to study groups of people, their relationships to each other, and their relationships to other networks. 

If you want to learn more, Prof. Jon Eastwood in Sociology teaches a course on social network analysis.

### Neo4j
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a "graph database." The "community edition" is easy to install and runs locally in your browser. Neo4j is well-documented and has a great training tutorial. Having experience with query languages like SQL will help with the learning curve.
