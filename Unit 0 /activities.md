* This is your moment! Select your domain name. Considerations:

  * Choosing your real name will help you create a professional presence online. 

  * If you choose something else, be prepared to live with it! I have started many new websites because I got tired of the cutesy name.

  * Your chosen name may be taken, so consider ways to make it unqiue.

* Be sure to check the box for WHOIS privacy so that your personal information is kept private.

* Leave the nameserver section as is.
