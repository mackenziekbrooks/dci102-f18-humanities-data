  # Unit 3 / Space / Data
  
For Unit 3, students may choose from any of the data sets used in this course: Ring-tum Phi, Shenandoah Index, or Stonewall Jackson Cemetery Database. 

Students may also choose to gather/collect or find their own data set. This option is subject to professor approval. If you have a data set or topic in mind, be prepared to answer the following:
* What makes this a "humanities" data set? 
* What is the source of your data? Do you have the correct permissions/rights to use it? 
* What is the spatial component to your data set? 
* What format is your data in? 
* What about your data might need to be cleaned or adjusted for visualization?
* Do you have a mapping/visualization tool in mind? 

## Spatial data basics
