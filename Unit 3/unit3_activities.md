# Unit 3 / Activities

## Activity 1: Omeka installation

For Prof. Youngman and Lenny's talk, you will need to have an instance of Omeka installed on your domain. This is a digital exhibit application with plugins for specific functions. We will be using a plugin called Neatline, which adds spatial and timeline functionality to Omeka.   
1. Log into your domain's CPanel. `http://www.yourdomain.com/cpanel`  
2. Navigate to Applications &gt; All Applications.   
3. In the Content Management System section, you should find Omeka.   
4. Click on the Omeka icon, then select "Install this application."   
5. Important! Fill in the `Directory (optional)` field with something like "omeka" or another name of your choosing. This prevents Omeka from wiping out your current Wordpress installation.   
6. In the Settings section, choose a more meaningful username and password. Otherwise, you can accept the default settings.   
7. You can log into the backend of Omeka by going to `http://www.yourdomain.com/omeka/admin`.   
8. You will need to install the Neatline plugin. Download the [plugin from the Omeka website](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatline/).  
9. Do not unzip the file on your computer. Rather, in the File Manager section of CPanel, navigate to `public_html/omeka/plugins` and upload the zip file.   
10. From this folder, you should be able to "Extract" the zip file.   
11. Return to the Omeka admin site, then navigate to the Plugins link in the top menu. You should see Neatline and other plugins listed.   
12. Install and activate the new plugins.

## Activity 2: Unit 3 planning

Now that we have worked through two units, students will be construct this unit and

* What are the phases of a project? How should we divide them up over the remaining weeks?
* What data will we/you use?
* What methodologies and tools do we need?

## Activity 3: Collaborative research

Contribute to a collaborative research document on Box.

* Scour our readings + project websites
* Check out DH aggregators like:
  * [DH+lib](http://acrl.ala.org/dh/)
  * Digital Humanities Now
  * DH journals
  * DH centers \(Scholars' Lab, Stanford, etc.\)
* Informed Googling
* Ask your network

Address the following:

* Projects
* Tools
* Tutorials
* Places to go for data
* Places to go for maps
* Readings

## Activity 4: Mapping tools

At your tables, explore some mapping tools \(Neatline, Google Maps, qGIS, Story Maps, StoryMapJS\) and address the following questions:

* What can I do?
* What data does it accept?
* Can I add a historical map?
* How do I add vector layers?
* Where is the map coming from?
* Who created this tool?

## Activity 5: Data assessment

* What makes this a "humanities" data set?
* What is the source of your data? Do you have the correct permissions/rights to use it?
* What is the spatial component to your data set?
* What format is your data in?
* What about your data might need to be cleaned or adjusted for visualization?
* Do you have a mapping/visualization tool in mind?

## Activity 6: Challenge peer review



* Spend 5 minutes brainstorming your biggest challenge for your mapping project. The challenge should be an unsolved question about your technical strategy or intellectual direction, not just the usual time/effort constraints.
* Share your challenge with the table. Your classmates are charged with helping you brainstorm possible solutions. 
  * Practice your troubleshooting skills. What can you find on the course site? Google? 
  * What can you advise based on your own experience so far? 
  * Are there similar projects they should look at? Suggestions for maps, images, or other media?
* Brainstorm/share for 10 minutes before moving onto the next person.
