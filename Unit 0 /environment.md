# Environment

Just as you might outfit your study carrel with all the essentials, your computer also needs to be set up with all the right tools. Preparing as much as you can ahead of time keeps you from losing momentum when that new tool you want to try has more dependencies than you expected. Automate the boring stuff! 

## Zotero
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a citation manager. They offer browser plugins so you can capture citation information directly from the web. There is also a standalone desktop app (and [text mining possibilities](http://papermachines.org/)!) as well. There's even a plug-in for MS Word that will automatically generate your bibliography. 

I have made our course readings available in a Zotero library. 

## Homebrew
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) makes it easy to install various packages on a Mac.
