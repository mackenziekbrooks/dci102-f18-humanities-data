# please seat yourselves by operating system 
Macs with Macs, Windows with Windows

# we can all be technical with the right teacher	

# html
* is structured 
* is semantic markup
* is made up of elements/tags
* describes the content

# head vs. body
* ```<head>``` contains metadata, isn't displayed
* ```<body>``` contains the content, is displayed

# css
* affects the way your page looks
* is a different language/syntax than html
* saves time/ensures consistency
* styles the content

# How computers work 
* series of commands
* binary
* layers of abstraction
* humans

# operating systems
* windows
* mac
* unix/linux

# Command line 
* vs. GUI
* container = shell 
* tree structure

# syntax
```$ command parameters -flag ```

* $ says start after me
* command = what to do
* parameters = how to do it
* flag = use this option

# install python 
instructions are in Box > Unit 0

# for tuesday
* guest speaker: Sarah McEleney
* practice command line
* start on methodology review assignment (due Thursday)
