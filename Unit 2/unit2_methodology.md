  # Unit 2 / Network / Methodology
Networks are everywhere. Once you start, it's hard to stop seeing them. The internet is a network, Facebook is a network, [Kevin Bacon is the central node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) in the Hollywood network. 

As we saw in Unit 1, computers are great at *computing*, but humans are still required for intepretation. 

 
## Defining methods
### Networks, nodes, and edges
A network is, as Scott Weingart [says](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/), "stuff and relationships." One piece of "stuff" is a "node" and the relationship/connection between two pieces of "stuff" is an "edge." Nodes are also called points, vertices, or agents. 

### Network analysis


### Network visualization


### Graph database


## Tools




### Neo4j
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a "graph database." The "community edition" is easy to install and runs locally in your browser. Neo4j is well-documented and has a great training tutorial. Having experience with query languages like SQL will help with the learning curve.
