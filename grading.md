# Grading

This course will use an alternative grading model known as "Specifications Grading." The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising the academic standards. I chose this system to complement the Digital Humanities methodologies we will be using this semester and to combat the grade anxiety rampant at W&L. The DH community values "productive failure." Thus, you need to be able to learn from your mistakes without worrying that it will affect your final grade. The course has been structured in a way that allows students to "self-select" their grade based on the amount and complexity of the assignments they complete.

## Features of this system:

* The majority of assignments will be graded on a pass\/fail basis. There will be no credit for partial work.
* You will be given clear and descriptive "specs" on each assignment so you know exactly what makes a passing assignment. 
* Projects will be bundled in a way that clearly delineates A, B, and C-level work. 
* You will receive three "free passes" to use for revisions, late assignments, or absences. You must indicate your use of a free pass before it's taken, not as CYA method.
* All the requirements must be met in full to receive the corresponding grade.
