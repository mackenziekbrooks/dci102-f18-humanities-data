# Unit 3 / Space / Assignments

## Core Assignments

### Methodology Review
To familiarize yourself with the various methodologies in the DH world, please conduct a review of one DH project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses textual data as its source. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday 12/8/16 by 2:30pm.
* 300-500 words. 
* Submit via your Box folder. 
* Be prepared to share your review in class. 
* Do not quote extensively from the project website. Summarize in your own words.
* Address the following questions:
  * What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions?
  * Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved? 
  * Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? 
  * What established standards (technical or otherwise) does the project data use? 
  * What network analysis methods are at play? What tools are being used? Does the methodology seem appropriate to the data and goals?
  * Consider the design of the project. What aspects of the project does the design privilege? How does the design affect your understanding of the material? 
  * How open is the project? Do they share their data? In what format? Is there public documentation?
 
Projects:

* [Textual Geographies](http://txtgeo.net/)


### Project data 
At the beginning of each unit, you will be handed a messy data set. It is a rare thing to find a perfectly structured and organized set of data in the wild. A major component of your work during each unit will involve turning this data into something usable for visualization or other types of analysis. "Usable," of course, depends on the nature of your project. Ideally, a clean and well-structured data set can serve a variety of uses AND live beyond specific tools or visualization trends. 

Specs: 
* Due Thursday 12/8/16 by 2:30pm.
* If possible, submit your data set in a zipped folder via Box.
* If possible, make your data available to download on your website. You could provide a link to Box, or upload a zip file via CPanel and File manager. 
* Include a text file titled "data-assessment-DATE.txt" that addresses the following:
  * What makes this a "humanities" data set? 
  * What is the source of your data? Do you have the correct permissions/rights to use it? 
  * What is the spatial component to your data set? 
  * What format is your data in? 
  * What about your data might need to be cleaned or adjusted for visualization?
* Include a text file titled "data-cleanup-DATE.txt" with a list of the modifications you made to your data set. Those modifications could include:
  * Adding/deleting data to alter the visualization/map.
  * Correcting erroneous data.
  * Separating or combining columns of data. 
  * Any external research you may have conducted to find a historical map or add information to your data set. 
  * Any adjustments you made to the mapping platform (ex: changing the base map in Neatline).
* Include a text file title "data-license-DATE.txt" that includes the following:
  * Use Open Data Commons to help you select an appropriate license for your data set. 

### Project visualization
For this unit, your visualization should feature some kind of map. You can use a modern or historical map. Your map can be created from existing data, or you can create a new set of data to layer on to a map. Your data must contain some kind of spatial element.

Specs:
* Due Thursday 12/8 by 2:30pm.
* Embed/publish on your website. 
* Include 150-200 words on why you selected this visualization. 
  * What did you learn about your data from this visualization, if anything?
  * What about the methodology worked or didn't work?
  * Are there issues with the data that the visualization illuminates or disguises?
  * Does this method of visualization require you to modify your data in a particular way?
* Indicate which tool/method you used to produce this visualization.



## Advanced Assignments
### Project narrative
Because we are short on time, you're not being expected to design and implement a full-scale data-driven project. This assignment asks you to use your imagination about what this project could become. Now that you're familiar with the data, what paths would you like to pursue? How would you introduce this data set to the uninitiated? Think about the "About" pages we've seen during your Project Review assignment. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday 12/8 by 2:30pm.
* Embed/publish on your website OR submit via your Box folder. 
* 150-300 words. 
* Introduce the data set and provide context. Save the technical details for the project documentation assignment.
* Identify your disciplinary angle. Are you approaching this project as a historian, a literature person, someone else entirely? Who is your audience?
* Include three potential research questions. 


### Project documentation
As you have reviewed projects and experimented with various tools, you have found yourself relying on their documentation. Documentation is super important, but it doesn't always get the attention it deserves. Documenting your process, your project, and everything in between helps yourself and others. Ever gone back to a project after time away? Was it hard to remember where you left off? (This will only get worse as you get older). Documentation is a gift to your future self. A detailed description of what you did and how you did it will help your external audience as well. Your work can serve as inspiration or help someone through a similar problem. Last but not least, documentation is a workplace reality. Your boss and your team will want to know what you've been working on. 

Your professor is not your audience. Imagine a friend or family member trying to recreate what you have done in this unit using your documentation.

Check out [A Beginner's Guide to Writing Documentation](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/) for more guidance.

Specs:
* Due Thursday 12/8/16 by 2:30pm.
* Publish to your website.
* Address the following:
  * What is your data set? Where did it come from? Who owns it? 
  * What did you do to your data? How did you do it?
  * What tools did you use to clean and visualize your data? How did you use them? What steps did you follow? 
  * How did you add the data to your map?
* Include screenshots and links when appropriate.
* Be specific!


### Project reflection
The final assignment for this unit a piece of reflective writing. Talk about your feelings. What have you learned? What has been challenging? How has your relationship with technology changed? What would you have done differently? Reflect on Unit 3 and the course as a whole. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday 12/8/16 by 2:30pm. 
* Submit via your Box folder. You are welcome, but not required to post to your website.
* 300-500 words.
* Address the following: 
  * What have you learned?
  * What has been challenging? 
  * How has your relationship with technology changed? What about your conception of data?
  * What would you have done differently? 



## Blog posts
You are free to choose the topic of your blog posts, as long as there is a connection to what we're covering in the course. You are encouraged to link to articles or embed relevant images (with citations!). If you need inspiration, here are few ideas:

* Respond to the [Dear Data project](http://www.dear-data.com/). There are videos to watch! 
* What novel/movie/or other piece of media would you like to see mapped? Example: [The Map of Middle Earth](http://lotrproject.com/map/#zoom=3&lat=-1315.5&lon=1500&layers=B)

Specs:
* 2 blog posts due Thursday 12/8/16 by 2:30pm. (I recommend spacing them out!)
* Publish to your own domain. 
* 300-500 words per post.
* Link to outside articles and embed images (with citations!), if relevant.
* Watch your tone. You are free to have personality and style, but remember that this is an academic/professional project. Find a balance between Buzzfeed and a scholarly journal.
