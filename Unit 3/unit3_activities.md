# Unit 3 / Activities

## Activity 1: Collaborative research
Contribute to a collaborative research document on Box. The final document will be added to the course site as reference for completing the Unit 3 project. 


1. In Box, open the Boxnote in ```DH102-f17-data/Unit3_Spatial``` with your table number.
2. Phase 1: Gathering. Work as a group to add resources to every category listed below. Add anything you think looks useful. 
3. Phase 2: Refining. Open the next table's Boxnote and review the findings of the group. If there's a resource that your group also found, copy it to the master document in Box. 
4. Phase 3: Annotating. In the ```MasterMappingResearch```, claim 1 resource and 1 glossary term by putting your initials in front of it. Write 1-2 sentence annotation summarizing that resource and arguing for its presence on the list. For example: "This tutorial covers the process of geoprectifying a historical map. It was created as part of a workshop on digital history by a history professor."

Categories: 
* Projects
* Tools
* Tutorials
* Data sources
* Map sources
* Readings
* Glossary

*** 
Evaluate:
* When was it created? 
* Who created it? Why should we trust them?
* What tech is required? Mac or PC? Web app or desktop app? 
* Designed for scholars or business? 
* Size/scope. Is this a big data set? A long tutorial?

## Activity 2: Data assessment

* What makes this a "humanities" data set?
* What is the source of your data? Do you have the correct permissions/rights to use it?
* What is the spatial component to your data set?
* What format is your data in?
* What about your data might need to be cleaned or adjusted for visualization?
* Do you have a mapping/visualization tool in mind?


## Activity 3: Mapping tools

At your tables, explore some mapping tools (TBD) and address the following questions:

* What can I do?
* What data does it accept?
* Can I add a historical map?
* How do I add vector layers?
* Where is the map coming from?
* Who created this tool?


## Activity 4: Challenge peer review

* Spend 5 minutes brainstorming your biggest challenge for your mapping project. The challenge should be an unsolved question about your technical strategy or intellectual direction, not just the usual time/effort constraints.
* Share your challenge with the table. Your classmates are charged with helping you brainstorm possible solutions. 
  * Practice your troubleshooting skills. What can you find on the course site? Google? 
  * What can you advise based on your own experience so far? 
  * Are there similar projects they should look at? Suggestions for maps, images, or other media?
* Brainstorm/share for 10 minutes before moving onto the next person.
