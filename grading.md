# Grading

This course will use an alternative grading model known as "Specifications Grading." The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the Digital Humanities methodologies we will be using this semester and to combat the grade anxiety rampant at W&L. The DH community values "productive failure." Thus, you need to be able to learn from your mistakes without worrying that it will affect your final grade. The course has been structured in a way that allows students to "self-select" their grade based on the amount and complexity of the assignments they complete.

## Features of this system:

* All assignments will be graded on a pass/not pass basis. There will be no credit for partial work.
* You will be given clear and descriptive "specs" on each assignment so you know exactly what makes a passing assignment.
* All the requirements must be met in full to receive the corresponding grade.
* You will receive three  "free passes" to use for revisions, late assignments, or absences. For absences or late assignments, you must declare your free pass as the time of the deadline, not after. For revisions, you must respond to your assignment feedback from me with a notice that you want to use a free pass, then submit your revision within 48 hours.
* I will reserve the plus/minus part of your grade to recognize exceptional or disappointing participation and engagement in class. I'll give you feedback on your participation with each unit's feedback.
