# Unit 1 / Text / Data 

## Background
For our first challenge, we will tackle a familiar source: the [Ring-tum Phi Archive](https://repository.wlu.edu/handle/11021/26338). 

The Ring-tum Phi (RTP) is Washington and Lee's student newspaper, published on a weekly basis since 1897. The RTP is a great source for institutional and local history. It can also serve as a window into the college student perspective on current events. For instance, someone interested in the [history of downtown Lexington](http://historiclexington.omeka.wlu.edu/) can learn more about area businesses by the advertisements. Someone interested in the [co-education decision](http://beyondbowties.academic.wlu.edu/) in 1985 could read op-eds from current students. 

But how do you find what you're looking for in the RTP? How do you browse if you don't know what you're looking for? 

Currently, the RTP is available in several forms
