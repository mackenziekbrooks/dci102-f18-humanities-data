### Participation & Engagement
In this class we'll engage with unfamiliar technology and concepts in what is hopefully a supportive, inclusive environment. I depend on you to be an active, prepared member of this course. We have a two hour course block in order to accomodate the hands-on technical work required for your projects, so attendance is essential. That being said, you can demonstrate engagement with the course through a variety of means - not just being talkative in class. 

* Blog posts (1 point each). You can write up to 2 posts per unit. Topics and due dates can be found on the assignments page. 
* Activities (1 point each). You can earn up to 2 points per unit by completing activities begun in class.
* Speakers (1 point each). You can earn up to 2 points by attending relevant speaker events and writing a blog post about the talk and its connection to the class s. Relevant speakers will be included on the schedule. 

If you're unable to attend class, please notify me before class begins. Each unexcused absence will deduct 5 points from your final grade.
