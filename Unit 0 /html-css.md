# HTML + CSS

## How the web works
The internet is magic. Just kidding, it's really not. The internet is made up of computers connected to other computers. 


## HTML
HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is one of the basic building blocks of the web. HTML is a set of tags that add structure to documents. 

When you write a document, you rely on style to indicate something about the text. You might put the title in a bigger font or break up paragraphs with tabs or new lines. Markup languages do this by adding tags around the content you wish to set apart. For example: ```<title>The Lord of the Rings</title>``` or ```<p>This is a whole paragraph.</p>``` Your human eyes and brain can infer things based on visual appear that computers need to be told explicitly. That's why we need semantic markup.

You can see the HTML for a basic website at the [W3 Schools HTML tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/). 

In fact, you can see the HTML for any page on the web by right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "view page source."

HTML documents are just plain text documents. You can write and read HTML in a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime. The magic happens when you open an HTML document in the browser. 

## Exercise 1
Open your favorite text editor and using the W3 Schools as a guide, write your own HTML document. 

Tasks:
* Add five types of tags to the body of your HTML document, including a table.
* Add an additional HTML page and link the two pages.


## CSS 
Our next building block of the web is CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. HTML structures your webpage, but you need something else to add the pretty colors and images. 

CSS has a different syntax than HTML. First you identify the HTML tag, then you declare the styles you wish to apply. ```title {color: red;}```

See some basic CSS at the [W3 Schools CSS tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp). 

The beauty of CSS is that you can keep all your styles in one stylesheet which you link to all your HTML pages. 

## Exercise 2

Create a separate CSS document and link it to your HTML document. 

Tasks:
* Add a background color.
* Change the border on your table. 
* Add style to your links when you hover over them.
