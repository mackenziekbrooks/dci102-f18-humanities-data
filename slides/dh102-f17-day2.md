# DH, chap 1
* "humanities" as traditionally text-based disciplines
* digitization of print cultural record
* digital environment brings new conventions, need for standards, and a focus on design
* DH not a replacement for "traditional knowledge skills and methods"
* interfaces are important, but they can change, even with the same data
* collaboration is key
* vast and accessible digital archive changes way we learn

# "Limits"
* DH suffers from an identity crisis
* DH is overstating the effect the "digital"
* DH makes assumptions and observations that aren't grounded in facts
* DH seeks to make traditional humanities obsolete
* DH tools are only good for "understanding things in mass," they still require a knowledgeable scholar to ask the right questions
* DH should resist and critique the digital

# "Defining Data"
* Data is an artifact
* Data can be interpreted as texts
* Data can be computed/processed
* Data is not evidence on its own, but can be used as evidence
* Humanists can use their own skill-set and apply it to data
