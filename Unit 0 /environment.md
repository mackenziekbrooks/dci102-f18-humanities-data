# Environment

Just as you might outfit your study carrel with all the essentials, your computer also needs to be set up with all the right tools. Preparing as much as you can ahead of time keeps you from losing momentum when that new tool you want to try has more dependencies than you expected. Make the computer work for you. 

## Zotero
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a citation manager. They offer browser plugins so you can capture citation information directly from the web. There is also a standalone desktop app (and [text mining possibilities](http://papermachines.org/)!) as well. There's even a plug-in for MS Word that will automatically generate your bibliography. 

I have made our course readings available in a Zotero [group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/dh102-f16). Let me know if you want to join and add resources.

## Homebrew
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) makes it easy to install various packages on a Mac.


## Text editors
Microsoft Word or Google Drive are great apps for writing papers. They make it easy to style and present a document. However, to work with text in a programmatic way, or to write code, we need a different app. 

## Note taking
[Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is a new framework for open annotation of the web. It operates via a Chrome extension allowing you to make private and public comments on websites. I have set up a [private group](https://hypothes.is/groups/XnMbDqV8/dh102-f16) for our course if you want to participate.

If you're a big note-taker, [Evernote](https://evernote.com) is a great option. Available on the web, desktop, or mobile device.
