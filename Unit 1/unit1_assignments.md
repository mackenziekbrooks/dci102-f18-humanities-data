# Unit 1 / Text / Assignments

## Core Assignments

### Methodology Review
To familiarize yourself with the various methodologies in the DH world, please conduct a review of one DH project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses textual data as its source. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday, 9/22 by 8am. 
* 300-500 words. 
* Submit via your Box folder. 
* Be prepared to share your review in class. 
* Do not quote extensively from the project website. Summarize in your own words.
* Address the following questions:
  * What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions?
  * Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved? 
  * Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? 
  * What established standards (technical or otherwise) does the project data use? 
  * What text analysis methods are at play? What tools are being used? Does the methodology seem appropriate to the data and goals?
  * Consider the design of the project. What aspects of the project does the design privilege? How does the design affect your understanding of the material? 
  * How open is the project? Do they share their data? In what format? Is there public documentation?

### Project data 
At the beginning of each unit, you will be handed a messy data set. It is a rare thing to find a perfectly structured and organized set of data in the wild. A major component of your work during each unit will involve turning this data into something usable for visualization or other types of analysis. "Usable," of course, depends on the nature of your project. Ideally, a clean and well-structured data set can serve a variety of uses AND live beyond specific tools or visualization trends. 

Specs: 
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am.
* Submit in a zipped folder via Box.
* Include a text file titled "data-assessment-%DATE.txt" with the results of our in-class activity. 
* Include a text file titled "data-cleanup-%DATE.txt" with a list of the modifications you made to your data set. Those modifications should include:
  * 10 regular expressions patterns that have a major impact on your data set. Out of all the problems, what are the most important ones to solve?
  

### Project visualization
Now that you have some experience creating a usable data set - what can you do with it? From the tools we have experimented with in class, select your favorite and/or most meaningful visualization. This can be a graph, a word cloud, a topic model etc. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am. 
* Embed/publish on your website. 
* Include 100-200 words on why you selected this visualization. 
* 


## Advanced Assignments
### Project narrative
Because we are short on time, you're not being expected to design and implement a full-scale data-driven project. This assignment asks you to use your imagination about what this project could become. Now that you're familiar with the data, what paths would you like to pursue? 

Specs:
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am. 
* Embed/publish on your website OR submit via your Box folder. 
* 250-300 words. 
* Identify your disciplinary angle. Are you approaching this project as a historian, a literature person, someone else entirely?
* Include three potential research questions. 

### Project documentation

### Project reflection
