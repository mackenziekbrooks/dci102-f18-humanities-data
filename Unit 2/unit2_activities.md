# Unit 2 / Activities

## Activity 1: Open Graph protocol
In this activity, you will semantically enrich your website using Facebook's [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/). As the site says, Open Graph Protocol "enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph." When you paste a link into Facebook or Twitter and an image and title show up nicely formatted, this is why.
1. Create a new HTML page or find one of your HTML pages from the first week in class. 
2. Create a new directory called "Unit2" in your domain. (Hint, go to File Manager).
3. Upload your HTML file to this new directory. Copy the URL of this HTML page. Ex. www.mackenziekbrooks.info/unit2/index.html.
4. Visit the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/) and paste in the URL. What do you see?
5. So let's add some metadata! Visit [http://ogp.me/](http://ogp.me/) and add the basic metadata fields as listed to your HTML file. 
6. Upload this file to your website, then paste the URL into the Debugger again. What do you see now?

## Activity 2: Data Assessment
Using Open Refine, explore your data set. In a text file to be turned in with Unit 2 Data, answer the following:
1. What do the "Text Facet" or "Numeric Facet" features reveal about your data? Are there outliers that need investigation?
2. Are there columns that should be split or joined? How would you do this in Open Refine (or Excel?) 
3. What columns would be best served by the "cluster and edit" feature? Why?
4. Which columns need to be modified for consistency? (hint: any date field)
5. Is there research you need to conduct to learn about the people in your data? How will you go about it? 

## Activity 3: Data Generation
* Fill this out [data generation survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSBKxh-rv1W8z8vPLdeurrtrN6QAt3QkhXY8plkB4lzAMHOw/viewform?c=0&w=1) to create a simple data set for testing network analysis tools. 
* Follow Miriam Posner's [tutorial](http://miriamposner.com/blog/a-fun-way-to-introduce-dh-students-to-dataviz/) to convert data to two columns. 
* Data is available as .csv on Box. 
* Load data into your chosen app for testing.


## Activity 4: Set Your Intentions
* What is my research question or topic?
* What are the biggest problems I have found with the data? What are realistic solutions?
* What methods/tools am I interested in using?
* What resources do I need?
* What are my next steps? Break them down!
