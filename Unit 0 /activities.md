# Activities

## Activity 1: Sign up with Reclaim Hosting

1. Visit [http://www.reclaimhosting.com](http://www.reclaimhosting.com)

2. Navigate to Products &gt; Shared Hosting &gt; Students & Individuals to sign up.

3. This is your moment! Select your domain name. Considerations:

   * Choosing your real name will help you create a professional presence online.

   * If you choose something else, be prepared to live with it! I have started many new websites because I got tired of the cutesy name.

   * Your chosen name may be taken, so consider ways to make it unqiue.

4. Be sure to check the box for WHOIS privacy so that your personal information is kept private.

5. Leave the nameserver section as is.

6. Fill out the payment details to complete registration.

7. **Important!** Be sure to save the confirmation email as it will contain your username and password to access the backend of your site. You will definitely need this in the future.

8. Add your URL to the Box note in our shared data folder in Box.

## Activity 2: Install Wordpress

1. Login to the Cpanel for your domain by adding `/cpanel` to the end of your URL. Use the username and password sent to you by Reclaim Hosting. 
2. You should see a Wordpress icon near the top of the page. Click on it to begin installing Wordpress.
3. Find the "install this application" button. 
4. Work through the installation. You can leave the default settings except for the following:  
   1. Directory \(optional\) - if you want your course website to live in subdirectory, such as `http://www.mackenziekbrooks.com/dh102` then type in the name of the subdirectory in the second box. I recommend using a subdirectory if you want to use your site for other purposes.

   1. Change the administrator username and password to something you are likely to remember.

   2. Customize the website title and tagline.

5. Press install to finish up.

6. You should now be able to access your wordpress admin interface by prepending `/wp-login` to your domain.

## Activity 3: HTML

* Open your favorite text editor and using the W3 Schools as a guide, write your own HTML document.
* Save the file as `index.html` in your Box folder in a separate folder titled: `activity_2016-09-13`.
* To view your page in the browswer, open `index.html` in your browser, usually with the key commands `Ctrl + o`
* You should include the basic set of tags: `<html> <head> <title> <body>`
* Add five additional types of tags to the body of your HTML document, including a table.
* Add an additional HTML page and link the two pages.

## Activity 4: CSS
