### Activity 1
Let's explore what's in the Ring-tum Phi! 
* Through the Digital Archive or the text files on your machine, start browsing the Ring-tum Phi.
* Not sure where to start? 
  * Look up the year you were born.
  * Find coverage of a major historical event.
  * Find Mock Con coverage. 
  * Mention of sorority/fraternity? 
  * Did your parent/older friend attend W&L?
  * Sports, music, or other W&L events?
  * Other ideas: diversity, alcohol/drug policies, gender issues, town and gown relations...
* Pay attention to your browsing experience. Is it easy to find what you're looking for? Are you tumbling down research rabbit holes?

### Activity 2
The type of OCR tool you need depends on your project. If you have modern documents, you might be okay with a less sophisticated tool. 

Compare and contrast the output of several OCR tools: 
* Use the TIFF files in the ```Unit1_Text``` in Box.
* Submit the same TIFF file to each of these tools. There's a document with instructions in Box.
  * Adobe Pro
  * Google Drive 
  * Tesseract
* Which tool does a better job? Which is easier to install? To use? Which tool is more efficient for the task at hand? What if you had to OCR 100 years of the RTP?
