# Unit 2 / Network / Data 

For the next two units, students will choose from two different data sets. 

## Shenandoah Index
Some of you may have heard of *[Shenandoah](http://shenandoahliterary.org/)*, the literary magazine associated with W&L. It was actually founded here in the 1950s by a group of students. Now, it's run by R.T. Smith and published exclusively online. 

By this point in the course, you will know that not everything is available online. The full text of *Shenandoah* is not available for free or purchase. None of the journal aggregators have even made the index available. A student worker in Special Collections (thanks Monica Musgrave) painstakingly typed up the spreadsheets you will work with during the 2014-2015 academic year. Until then, this data only existed in the covers of the print journal.
