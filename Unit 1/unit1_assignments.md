# Unit 1 / Text / Assignments

## Core Assignments

### Methodology Review
To familiarize yourself with the various methodologies in the DH world, please conduct a review of one DH project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses textual data as its source. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday, 9/22 by 8am. 
* 300-500 words. 
* Submit via your Box folder. 
* Be prepared to share your review in class. 
* Do not quote extensively from the project website. Summarize in your own words.
* Address the following questions:
  * What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions?
  * Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved? 
  * Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? 
  * What established standards (technical or otherwise) does the project data use? 
  * What text analysis methods are at play? What tools are being used? Does the methodology seem appropriate to the data and goals?
  * Consider the design of the project. What aspects of the project does the design privilege? How does the design affect your understanding of the material? 
  * How open is the project? Do they share their data? In what format? Is there public documentation?

### Project data 
At the beginning of each unit, you will be handed a messy data set. It is a rare thing to find a perfectly structured and organized set of data in the wild. A major component of your work during each unit will involve turning this data into something usable for visualization or other types of analysis. "Usable," of course, depends on the nature of your project. Ideally, a clean and well-structured data set can serve a variety of uses AND live beyond specific tools or visualization trends. 

Specs: 
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am.
* Submit in a zipped folder via Box.
* Include a text file titled "data-assessment-%DATE.txt" with the results of our in-class activity. 
* Include a text file titled "data-cleanup-%DATE.txt" with a list of the modifications you made to your data set. Those modifications should include:
  * 5 or more regular expressions patterns that have a major impact on your data set. Out of all the problems, what are the most important ones to solve?
  * Changes made to the existing file structure or file names.
  

### Project visualization
Now that you have some experience creating a usable data set - what can you do with it? From the tools we have experimented with in class, select your favorite and/or most meaningful visualization. This can be a graph, a word cloud, a topic model etc. Use "[Using Data Visualization to Find Insights in Data](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_7.html)" to guide your writing.

Specs:
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am. 
* Embed/publish on your website. 
* Include 100-200 words on why you selected this visualization. 
  * What did you learn about your data from this visualization, if anything?
  * What about the methodology worked or didn't work?
  * Are there issues with the data that the visualization illuminates or disguises?
* Indicate which tool/method you used to produce this visualization. 


## Advanced Assignments
### Project narrative
Because we are short on time, you're not being expected to design and implement a full-scale data-driven project. This assignment asks you to use your imagination about what this project could become. Now that you're familiar with the data, what paths would you like to pursue? How would you introduce this data set to the uninitiated? Think about the "About" pages we've seen during your Project Review assignment. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am. 
* Embed/publish on your website OR submit via your Box folder. 
* 250-300 words. 
* Introduce the data set and provide context. 
* Identify your disciplinary angle. Are you approaching this project as a historian, a literature person, someone else entirely? Who is your audience?
* Include three potential research questions. 


### Project documentation
As you have reviewed projects and experimented with various tools, you have found yourself relying on their documentation. Documentation is super important, but it doesn't always get the attention it deserves. Documenting your process, your project, and everything in between helps yourself and others. Ever gone back to a project after time away? Was it hard to remember where you left off? (This will only get worse as you get older). Documentation is a gift to your future self. A detailed description of what you did and how you did it will help your external audience as well. Your work can serve as inspiration or help someone through a similar problem. Last but not least, documentation is a workplace reality. Your boss and your team will want to know what you've been working on. 

Your professor is not your audience. Imagine a friend or family member trying to recreate what you have done in this unit using your documentation.

Check out [A Beginner's Guide to Writing Documentation](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/) for more guidance.

Specs:
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am. 
* Publish to your website.
* Address the following:
  * What is your data set? Where did it come from? Who owns it? 
  * What did you do to your data? How did you do it?
  * What tools did you use? How did you use them? What steps did you follow? 
* Include screenshots when appropriate.

### Project reflection
The final assignment for this unit a piece of reflective writing. Talk about your feelings. What have you learned? What has been challenging? How has your relationship with technology changed? What would you have done differently? What new strategies will you try in the next unit?

Specs:
* Due Thursday 10/6 by 8am. 
* Submit via your Box folder. You are welcome, but not required to post to your website.
* 300-500 words.
* Address the following: 
  * What have you learned? 
  * What has been challenging? 
  * How has your relationship with technology changed? 
  * What would you have done differently? 
  * What new strategies will you try in the next unit?


## Blog posts
You are free to choose the topic of your blog posts, as long as there is a connection to what we're covering in the course. You are encouraged to link to articles or embed relevant images (with citations!). If you need inspiration, here are few ideas:

* How would you define your relationship with technology? How has that changed over your lifetime? What are some ways you see societal norms changing due to your generation's relationship with technology?
* What does big data mean to you personally? To your field of study? To your future career path? 
* Relatedly, respond to the *Geolocation* exhibit and readings. 
* What interesting stuff have you found in *Ring-tum Phi*? Anything that would make a cool research project? Is there a period of W&L's history that you'd like to learn more about? How would you compare that period to today? 

Specs:
* 2 blog posts due 10/6 by 8am. (I recommend spacing them out!)
* Publish to your own domain. 
* 300-500 words
* Link to outside articles and embed images (with citations!), if relevant.
