  # Unit 1 / Text / Methodology 
There are a wide variety of methods for analyzing textual data. Obviously, we will not be able to cover them all in-depth. The goal of this unit is to introduce you to text analysis methods and the steps required to assemble a textual data set. Because this is a data-focused course, we are not spending time on digital methods for close reading. But they do exist!

## Defining methods

### Word frequency or counting words
Word frequency is a good place to start. How many times does a specific word occur in a document? In a corpus? 

You've probably seen this executed in the form of a word cloud. The more frequently a word appears, the larger the size.

For more introduction, check out ["Basic Text Mining: Word Clouds, their Limitations, and Moving Beyond."](http://www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=633)

### Collocation and context
So we have some frequently-used words. What about their neighbors? Are there patterns to the words that appear around our frequently-used words? Where is the document do those words appear? Near the beginning or the end? 

### N-grams 
For our purposes, n-grams are phrases of a certain length or "n". Technically, linguists consider n-grams to be "a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)).

[Google Books Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) is a popular tool for visualizing n-grams over time in the Google Books data set. 

Prof. Brandon Walsh delves into the nuances of the Ngram Viewer over on his [text analysis workbook](https://bmw9t.gitbooks.io/introduction-to-text-analysis/content/issues/google-ngram.html).
### Topic modeling
A complex technique for determining the topic or a list of topics of a document/corpus.

### Sentiment analysis 

## Tools
### Wordle
Easy to use word cloud generator. 

### Voyant
A classic text analyis tool. Accepts single documents or entire corpora.

I recommend [running Voyant locally](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/resources/run-your-own/voyant-server/) so it doesn't stress their servers.
