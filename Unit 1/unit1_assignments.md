### Methodology Review
To familiarize yourself with the various methodologies in the DH world, please conduct a review of one DH project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses textual data as its source. 

Specs:
* Due Thursday, 9/22 by 8am. 
* 300-500 words. 
* Submit via your Box folder. 
* Be prepared to share your review in class. 
* Do not quote extensively from the project's text. Summarize in your own words.
* Address the following questions:
  * What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions?
  * Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved? 
  * Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? 
  * What established standards (technical or otherwise) does the project data use? 
  * What text analysis methods are at play? What tools are being used? Does the methodology seem appropriate to the data and goals?
  * Consider the design of the project. What aspects of the project does the design privilege? How does the design affect your understanding of the material? 
  * How open is the project? Do they share their data? In what format? Is there public documentation?
