## Core Assignments

### Methodology Review
To familiarize yourself with the various methodologies in the DH world, please conduct a review of one DH project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses textual data as its source. 

Specs:
* Due Tuesday, 10/18 by 8am. 
* 300-500 words. 
* Submit via your Box folder. 
* Be prepared to share your review in class. 
* Do not quote extensively from the project website. Summarize in your own words.
* Address the following questions:
  * What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions?
  * Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved? 
  * Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? 
  * What established standards (technical or otherwise) does the project data use? 
  * What network analysis methods are at play? What tools are being used? Does the methodology seem appropriate to the data and goals?
  * Consider the design of the project. What aspects of the project does the design privilege? How does the design affect your understanding of the material? 
  * How open is the project? Do they share their data? In what format? Is there public documentation?

### Project data 
At the beginning of each unit, you will be handed a messy data set. It is a rare thing to find a perfectly structured and organized set of data in the wild. A major component of your work during each unit will involve turning this data into something usable for visualization or other types of analysis. "Usable," of course, depends on the nature of your project. Ideally, a clean and well-structured data set can serve a variety of uses AND live beyond specific tools or visualization trends. 

Specs: 
* Due Tuesday 11/8/16 by 8am.
* Submit in a zipped folder via Box.
* Include a text file titled "data-assessment-%DATE.txt" with the results of our in-class activity. 
* Include a text file titled "data-cleanup-%DATE.txt" with a list of the modifications you made to your data set. Those modifications could include:
  * All fields should be standardized to the most appropriate data type (Date, String, etc.)
  * Reconcile names to an external authority if possible (Shenandoah data set).
  * Separation into multiple csv files for more specific analysis.
  

### Project visualization
Now that you have some experience creating a usable data set - what can you do with it? From the tools we have experimented with in class, select your favorite and/or most meaningful visualization. For this unit, your visualizaiton should be some kind of network graph. Use "[Using Data Visualization to Find Insights in Data](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_7.html)" to guide your writing.

Specs:
* Due Tuesday 11/8 by 8am.
* Embed/publish on your website. 
* Include 150-200 words on why you selected this visualization. 
  * What did you learn about your data from this visualization, if anything?
  * What about the methodology worked or didn't work?
  * Are there issues with the data that the visualization illuminates or disguises?
  * Does this method of visualization require you to 
* Indicate which tool/method you used to produce this visualization.

## Advanced Assignments
### Project narrative
Because we are short on time, you're not being expected to design and implement a full-scale data-driven project. This assignment asks you to use your imagination about what this project could become. Now that you're familiar with the data, what paths would you like to pursue? How would you introduce this data set to the uninitiated? Think about the "About" pages we've seen during your Project Review assignment. 

Specs:
* Due Tuesday 11/8 by 8am.
* Embed/publish on your website OR submit via your Box folder. 
* 150-300 words. 
* Introduce the data set and provide context. Save the technical details for the project documentation assignment.
* Identify your disciplinary angle. Are you approaching this project as a historian, a literature person, someone else entirely? Who is your audience?
* Include three potential research questions. 


### Project documentation
As you have reviewed projects and experimented with various tools, you have found yourself relying on their documentation. Documentation is super important, but it doesn't always get the attention it deserves. Documenting your process, your project, and everything in between helps yourself and others. Ever gone back to a project after time away? Was it hard to remember where you left off? (This will only get worse as you get older). Documentation is a gift to your future self. A detailed description of what you did and how you did it will help your external audience as well. Your work can serve as inspiration or help someone through a similar problem. Last but not least, documentation is a workplace reality. Your boss and your team will want to know what you've been working on. 

Your professor is not your audience. Imagine a friend or family member trying to recreate what you have done in this unit using your documentation.

Check out [A Beginner's Guide to Writing Documentation](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/) for more guidance.

Specs:
* Due Tuesday 11/8 by 8am.
* Publish to your website.
* Address the following:
  * What is your data set? Where did it come from? Who owns it? 
  * What did you do to your data? How did you do it?
  * What tools did you use to clean and visualize your data? How did you use them? What steps did you follow? 
* Include screenshots when appropriate.

### Project reflection
The final assignment for this unit a piece of reflective writing. Talk about your feelings. What have you learned? What has been challenging? How has your relationship with technology changed? What would you have done differently? What new strategies will you try in the next unit?

Specs:
* Due Tuesday 11/8 by 8am. 
* Submit via your Box folder. You are welcome, but not required to post to your website.
* 300-500 words.
* Address the following: 
  * What have you learned?
  * What has been challenging? 
  * How has your relationship with technology changed? What about your conception of data?
  * What would you have done differently? 
  * What new strategies will you try in the next unit?


## Blog posts
You are free to choose the topic of your blog posts, as long as there is a connection to what we're covering in the course. You are encouraged to link to articles or embed relevant images (with citations!). If you need inspiration, here are few ideas:

* How do you see networks functioning in your own life? 
* What networks would you like to look at in or outside of your own field of study? Why? 
* What interests you about the data set you have chosen to work with? What other local history topics could use network analysis/visualization?
* Respond/reflect on our reading on Critical DH.

Specs:
* 2 blog posts due Tuesday 11/8 by 8am. (I recommend spacing them out!)
* Publish to your own domain. 
* 300-500 words per post.
* Link to outside articles and embed images (with citations!), if relevant.
* Watch your tone. You are free to have personality and style, but remember that this is an academic/professional project. Find a balance between Buzzfeed and a scholarly journal.
