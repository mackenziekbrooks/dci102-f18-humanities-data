# Unit 3 / Methodology

In this unit, we will explore how spatial visualizations affect our understanding of a cultural object or process, be it a novel like Mrs. Dalloway or an historical event like Emancipation. How do you visualize movement in space using good design principles? How do you map fictional places?

Students will have the option of working with existing data sets from this course, or selecting a new data set \(subject to professor approval\). Now that we have worked through the project management cycle twice, students will be expected to assemble their projects independently. They will research mapping methodology and tools, design the project, create a clean data set, and assemble the project.

## Spatial data basics

* Raster data = layers historical maps or photographs
  * [http://mapwarper.net/](http://mapwarper.net/)
  * .TIFF or .JPG
* Vector data = layers points, lines, or polygons
  * KML \(Keyhole Markup Language\)
  * SVG \(form of XML\)
  * Shapefiles \(.shp, .shx, .dbf\) mostly open standard by ESRI \(Environmental Systems Research Institute\)
  * GeoJSON = shapes + geocoordinates


## Data
* https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab// - List of different data sets that could be used to develop a project. It is kind of helpful, however, most of the data sets are more social science oriented. They are also very large data sets, but they are available for download. It's worth looking at. (LA)
* https://www.data.gov/ - The home of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s open data. Here you will find data, tools, and resources to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations, and more. (HC)

## Map sources

## Tools
* CARTO: mapping events over time https://carto.com
* QGIS: http://www.qgis.org/en/site/ (CG) - As Ben Gorham mentioned on Tuesday, qGIS is essentially the free version of arcGIS. It's an opensource download, and so it has lots of helpful tools that are constantly evolving. 
* Neatline:     http://neatline.org/
