# Command Line
Most of us interact with our computers or phones through highly visual interfaces. We know what button to press because of the stylized image it contains. We understand what it means when a website has a blue "f" or when a friend sends a thumbs-up emoji. Your computer, regardless of operating system, wants to interact with you via icons. The term for this is Graphical User Interfaces or GUI (pronounced gooey). 

But there's another way. You can interact with your computer entirely via text commands through something called a Command Line Interface or CLI. When you see a hacker typing green text into a black box in a movie, they're using the command line. And you can too. 

If you're on a Mac, search for an app called Terminal. 

If you're on Windows, open cmd.exe. 

## But why? 

* The command line gives you power. It frees you from a lot of clicking and lets you inhabit a world where your computer does exactly what you say. 
* The command line lets you script and automate tasks and processes. It lets you perform the same set of actions on a one file or on many files. 
* The command line is often used for installing and running DH tools.

There are a lot of resources for learning the command line. We'll be using [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) in this class.
