# Environment

Just as you might outfit your study carrel with all the essentials, your computer also needs to be set up with all the right tools. Preparing as much as you can ahead of time keeps you from losing momentum when that new tool you want to try has more dependencies than you expected. Make the computer work for you. 

## Box
Did you know that W&L offers unlimited cloud storage while you're a student? We will use [http://box.wlu.edu/](https://www.wlu.edu/its/how-to/box-faq) to share course materials. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the platform.

One key feature of Box is Box Sync. This makes the contents of your Box folders accessible via the Finder or Windows Explorer. You will need to install Box Sync on your computer. 

## Zotero
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a citation manager. They offer browser plugins so you can capture citation information directly from the web. There is also a standalone desktop app (and [text mining possibilities](http://papermachines.org/)!) as well. There's even a plug-in for MS Word that will automatically generate your bibliography. 

I have made our course readings available in a Zotero [group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/dh102-f16). Let me know if you want to join and add resources.

## Homebrew
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) makes it easy to install various packages on a Mac.


## Text editors
Microsoft Word or Google Drive are great apps for writing papers. They make it easy to style and present a document. However, to work with text in a programmatic way, or to write code, we need a different app. MS Word adds a lot of hidden styling and other baggage that we don't need. One of the best features of text editors is that they can detect what language you're writing in and highlight the elements in different colors.

There are a lot of [options](http://lifehacker.com/five-best-text-editors-1564907215) for text editors. You're welcome to try on a few before choosing. I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), so I recommend you install it for consistency. 

## Note taking
[Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is a new framework for open annotation of the web. It operates via a Chrome extension allowing you to make private and public comments on websites. I have set up a [private group](https://hypothes.is/groups/XnMbDqV8/dh102-f16) for our course if you want to participate.

If you're a big note-taker, [Evernote](https://evernote.com) is a great option. Available on the web, desktop, or mobile device.
