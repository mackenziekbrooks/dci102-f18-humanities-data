  * What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions?
  * Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved? 
  * Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? 
  * What established standards (technical or otherwise) does the project data use? 
  * What network analysis methods are at play? What tools are being used? Does the methodology seem appropriate to the data and goals?
