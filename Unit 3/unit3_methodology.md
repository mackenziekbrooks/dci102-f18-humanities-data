# Unit 3 / Methodology

In this unit, we will explore how spatial visualizations affect our understanding of a cultural object or process, be it a novel like Mrs. Dalloway or an historical event like Emancipation. How do you visualize movement in space using good design principles? How do you map fictional places?

Students will have the option of working with existing data sets from this course, or selecting a new data set \(subject to professor approval\). Now that we have worked through the project management cycle twice, students will be expected to assemble their projects independently. They will research mapping methodology and tools, design the project, create a clean data set, and assemble the project.

## Spatial data basics

* Raster data = layers historical maps or photographs
  * [http://mapwarper.net/](http://mapwarper.net/)
  * .TIFF or .JPG
* Vector data = layers points, lines, or polygons
  * KML \(Keyhole Markup Language\)
  * SVG \(form of XML\)
  * Shapefiles \(.shp, .shx, .dbf\) mostly open standard by ESRI \(Environmental Systems Research Institute\)
  * GeoJSON = shapes + geocoordinates


## Data
* https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab// - List of different data sets that could be used to develop a project. It is kind of helpful, however, most of the data sets are more social science oriented. They are also very large data sets, but they are available for download. It's worth looking at. (LA)
* https://www.data.gov/ - The home of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s open data. Here you will find data, tools, and resources to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations, and more. (HC)

## Tools
* CARTO: mapping events over time https://carto.com
* QGIS: http://www.qgis.org/en/site/ (CG) - As Ben Gorham mentioned on Tuesday, qGIS is essentially the free version of arcGIS. It's an opensource download, and so it has lots of helpful tools that are constantly evolving. 
* Neatline:     http://neatline.org/

## Glossary
* LiDAR (CG)
  * LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging. According to the National Ocean Service webiste, LiDAR is " is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth."

* **Map tile**: separate images that together compose a web map
* **Data layer**: the separation of map data into discrete layers (which can be turned off and on)
* **GIS** : system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spacial or geographical data
* **Spatial autocorrelation**: measure of the degree in which spatial features and their data values tend to be clustered together or dispersed

    Geospatial Analysis: performing detailed analysis regarding the spatial relationships between datasets

    Features: graphic spatial representation of real-world physical features LA

    Real world features, such as trees and buildings, represented digitally

    Attributes: non-spatial data describing the features
